## Introduction

Despite almost a quarter of the world’s population living in rural areas, ruralfocused CSCW makes up a tiny fraction of published CSCW research and design. When CSCW work does focus on the rural there are issues with the way rurality is identified and
understood and limitations in the approaches to research and design in rural contexts.
Building on a recent increased interest in rural informatics, which has drawn on social
science scholarship to take stock of previous rural research and set an agenda for rural
computing, we aim to identify opportunities for CSCW research to engage with rural issues
and foster a rural informatics community of practice. As the world relies ever more on rural
areas and the importance of information technology to rural resilience is ever more
apparent, the need to innovate and design from the rural must become more central to
CSCW. 

The aim of this workshop was to  provide researchers and practitioners interested in rural CSCW
and rural computing an opportunity to discuss future directions and share insights,
ideas, and issues from different rural contexts. It facilitated cross-disciplinary
and cross-sector discussion, sharing, and understanding on current issues, research,
and community development work. The workshop created an opportunity to
collaboratively set pathways and approaches for a rural informatics research
agenda. As a result of the workshop we began to put together an action plan to orient future activity around key
rural challenges where CSCW researchers could have the biggest impact.

## Workshop Themes

The overall aim of this workshop was to create a plan of action for future rural
informatics research briding sociological considerations (i.e. that has a good
understanding of the challenges) with computing (i.e. what are the technological
potentials for sustainable and resilient rural communities). We explored:
what approaches are required in rural contexts? What can we learn from prior
CSCW work and its breakdowns? What additional complexities are there when
designing technologies in, for, with, and from the rural?

We suggested five broad topics for discussion, that cover the ontological nature (how
the rural came to be), epistemological questions (how we know and understand the
rural) and methodological questions (how we intervene as researchers and
designers) relevant to rural computing research:

1. Approaching the rural: Why rural? Establishing motivations and
inspirations.
2. Defining the rural: Who is rural? Identities, characteristics, and positionality.
3. Imagining the rural: Where is the rural? Contexts, boundaries, and
discourses; there is no single vantage point from which to see the rural whole;
so, we need to reflect upon the lenses (e.g. academic, media, lay), and frames
that we privilege, bypass, draw from, start from or end with.
4. Re-imagining the rural: When is the rural? How could different lenses and
frames of rural identities be used to re-imagine the rural?
5. Re-making the rural: How rural? Setting out approaches, methods, and
priorities.

## Materials

Participants were given pre-filled "workbooks" to provide some structure to the discussions and activities.

## Participants and presentations

Eleven people participated in our hybrid workshop - three online and eight in person.

Participants were invited to give short "lightning" presentations of around 3-5 mins to introduce themselves and their experiences of working in rural settings.

## From themes to (goals to) actions


Participants broke out into groups to identify goals for three key themes in rural CSCW research. 


### Energy

In response to skyrocketing energy prices, rural communities across Europe are forming renewable energy communities and energy production cooperatives, sometimes inspired by historic traditional models of collaboration. These efforts face practical challenges in the form of old and poorly insulated housing, energy grids unable to deal with additional capacity, and renewable generation technologies that do not meet energy demand patterns. However, the greatest challenges arise when dealing with the complex regulatory requirements, which can be very resource intensive. Participants discussed how future CSCW research on energy usage could shift away from its previous focus on individual behaviour change to instead focus on building community capacity for collective action on energy.

### Culture

Cultural barriers between researchers and rural communities presents a signficant challenge to successful participatory research with rural communities beyond existing partner organisations. Participants identified methodoligical challenges to accessing rural field sites and the necessity of forming long term reciprocal relationships with rural partners. In particular, there is a need for "polyvocality" in rural research to represent the diversity of the rural. Participants set a goal for future researcher to bridge the cultural differences between researchers and rural collaborators, acknowledging that this would require more of a focus on digital inclusion opportunities and accessibility. 

### Fragility

Fragility was identified as a theme linking infrastructure, technology, human networks, policy and culture in the rural. Participants identified the need to appreciate the complex and multi-faceted nature of smaller groups and the emergent practices resulting from their internal power dynamics. Participants advocated a focus on the particular needs of the rural context by developing concerns from the people that are being worked with, rather than general understandings and assumptions about rurality as a whole.



## Prioritising actions

After briefly feeding back as a group, further small group discussions then envisaged possible actions that could be taken by the rural CSCW community to further the previously identified goals.
