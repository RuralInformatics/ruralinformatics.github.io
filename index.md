Despite almost a quarter of the world’s population living in rural areas, ruralfocused CSCW makes up a tiny fraction of published CSCW research and design. When
CSCW work does focus on the rural there are issues with the way rurality is identified and
understood and limitations in the approaches to research and design in rural contexts.
Building on a recent increased interest in rural informatics, which has drawn on social
science scholarship to take stock of previous rural research and set an agenda for rural
computing, we aim to identify opportunities for CSCW research to engage with rural issues
and foster a rural informatics community of practice. As the world relies ever more on rural
areas and the importance of information technology to rural resilience is ever more
apparent, the need to innovate and design from the rural must become more central to
CSCW. 

This workshop will provide researchers and practitioners interested in rural CSCW
and rural computing an opportunity to discuss future directions and share insights,
ideas, and issues from different rural contexts. It will facilitate cross-disciplinary
and cross-sector discussion, sharing, and understanding on current issues, research,
and community development work. The workshop will create an opportunity to
collaboratively set pathways and approaches for a rural informatics research
agenda. We aim to create an action plan that will orient future activity around key
rural challenges where CSCW researchers can have the biggest impact.

## Schedule

The workshop will run over a half-day.

- **60-90 mins** Presentations and provocations: Co-organizers of this workshop,
additional experts within rural informatics and representatives from rural
community organizations will be invited to deliver fifteen to twenty minute
“provocations” informed by their ongoing work within rural contexts and
with rural communities. These might be context or domain-specific but
should relate to the thematic areas (i.e., defining the rural, imagining the
rural, etc.). The main aim of this session isto contribute to the later thematic
conversations by giving a glimpse into the plurality and diversity of the
rural, while also giving us some frameworks or lenses to see through
challenges and potential technological responses.
- **90-120 mins** Themed discussion tables. We will set up 3-4 tables with each
table focusing on one topic that we have identified from recent research
within rural communities. Each table will be coordinated by a facilitator
who will take notes during the discussion. The aim of these discussions will
be to mobilize experience of rural research and expertise from complementary research fields around the challenges presented in the “provocations”.
- **15-30 mins**  Summary and next steps. Organizers talk in plenary and set out
immediate next steps for the group. The notes from each discussion table
will be shared in order to provide key directions for CSCW research to
engage with rural challenges.


## Call for Participation

### Submission Format

We are asking participants  to submit an example of their work, such as a case study, position statement or equivalent, that demonstrates engagement either with rural informatics/rural computing or with a relevant area of interest. We are keen to keep the barrier to entry as low as possible to encourage participation from a wide range of academics and practitioners

We will select participants on the basis of ensuring
the discussions are dynamic and engaging and that all participants have time and
space to contribute whilst also including a broad range of backgrounds and
perspectives.

The deadline for submissions is the **30th May** (23:59 AoE).

Please submit using **[this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=yRJQnBa2wkSpF2aBT74-h-KB8YKuT_ZFnVbg1fRTp_VUQVJVUUQ5UVFaSzNEUDRFTFExMUs3SjBIWC4u)**.

### Workshop Themes

The overall aim of this workshop will be to create a plan of action for future rural
informatics research that bridges sociological considerations (i.e. that has a good
understanding of the challenges) with computing (i.e. what are the technological
potentials for sustainable and resilient rural communities). We aim to explore:
what approaches are required in rural contexts? What can we learn from prior
CSCW work and its breakdowns? What additional complexities are there when
designing technologies in, for, with, and from the rural?

We suggest five broad topics for discussion, that cover the ontological nature (how
the rural came to be), epistemological questions (how we know and understand the
rural) and methodological questions (how we intervene as researchers and
designers) relevant to rural computing research:

1. Approaching the rural: Why rural? Establishing motivations and
inspirations.
2. Defining the rural: Who isrural? Identities, characteristics, and positionality.
3. Imagining the rural: Where is the rural? Contexts, boundaries, and
discourses; there is no single vantage point from which to see the rural whole;
so, we need to reflect upon the lenses (e.g. academic, media, lay), and frames
that we privilege, bypass, draw from, start from or end with.
4. Re-imagining the rural: When is the rural? How could different lenses and
frames of rural identities be used to re-imagine the rural?
5. Re-making the rural: How rural? Setting out approaches, methods, and
priorities.

## Organisers

**[Ben Davies](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/people/ben-davies/)**

Ben is a first year PhD student exploring the design and use of digital technologies
for rural communities. He is interested in how social and technological
infrastructures support information sharing and civic participation, and in the
potential for socio-technical innovations to support rural resilience.

**[Ian G Johnson](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/people/ian-johnson/)**

Ian is a Lecturer in Human-Computer Interaction and Community Technologies at
Open Lab, Newcastle University. He has a background in the social sciences and
his PhD in Digital Civics was interdisciplinary across the School of Politics and the
School of Computing.
Ian’s research, published in CHI and CSCW, has investigated the role of the
researcher, and stakeholder power and influence during technology deployments
related to local decision-making, explored the interplay between data, knowledge
and evidence in local-level policymaking, on the creation of spaces for civic
discourse, and on the way citizen-led organizations can create resources for
democratic action through configuring participation during local consultation.

**[Nick Taylor](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/people/nick-taylor/)**

Nick is a Senior Lecturer in Human-Computer Interaction in Open Lab at
Newcastle University. His research attempts to understand the impact of emerging
technologies and practices, and to imagine, prototype and explore possible
preferable futures around those technologies. Much of this work has focused on the
role of technology in communities, including longitudinal technology deployments
in rural Lancashire.

**[Alan Chamberlain](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/people/alan.chamberlain)**

Alan is a Principal Research Fellow at the University of Nottingham, in the Mixed
Reality Lab, Computer Science. His research focuses upon interdisciplinary
approaches to Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Design. He has published
award-winning research in the leading conferences in the field, such as CHI and
CSCW. He continues to work internationally and is a visiting Professor at
Copenhagen Business School, and Aberystwyth University, where he is developing
interdisciplinary research initiatives relating to Design, AI, Robotics and ‘Rural
Informatics’.
