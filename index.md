Despite almost a quarter of the world’s population living in rural areas, ruralfocused CSCW makes up a tiny fraction of published CSCW research and design. When
CSCW work does focus on the rural there are issues with the way rurality is identified and
understood and limitations in the approaches to research and design in rural contexts.
Building on a recent increased interest in rural informatics, which has drawn on social
science scholarship to take stock of previous rural research and set an agenda for rural
computing, we aim to identify opportunities for CSCW research to engage with rural issues
and foster a rural informatics community of practice. As the world relies ever more on rural
areas and the importance of information technology to rural resilience is ever more
apparent, the need to innovate and design from the rural must become more central to
CSCW. 

This workshop will provide researchers and practitioners interested in rural CSCW
and rural computing an opportunity to discuss future directions and share insights,
ideas, and issues from different rural contexts. It will facilitate cross-disciplinary
and cross-sector discussion, sharing, and understanding on current issues, research,
and community development work. The workshop will create an opportunity to
collaboratively set pathways and approaches for a rural informatics research
agenda. We aim to create an action plan that will orient future activity around key
rural challenges where CSCW researchers can have the biggest impact.

## Schedule

The workshop will run over a half-day.

### 9:30 - 10:30  Presentations and provocations

Participants will be invited to give short "lightning" presentations of around 3-5 mins where people can introduce themselves and their experiences of working in rural settings.

**Presentations**
- Thomas Ludwig - Broad-based Digital Transformation: A South Westphalian Perspective on Participatory Socio-Technical Change
- Sharon Wagg - Digital Inclusion Network Development: A Case Study In Derbyshire
- Philipp Rutz - Transformation of the Automotive Industry in German Rural Regions
- Antti Knutas - Energy interface design principle prioritization workshop (for rural Finnish households)
- Ben Davies - Exploring rural resilience through a community display network
- Alan Dix - Techwaves overview
  
### 10:30 - 10:45 Coffee break

We will discuss what themes are emerging from the topics discussed in the presentations and from their own work. 

### 10:45 - 11:25 From themes to goals (group discussions)

We will break into small group discussions to unpack some of these themes with a focus on:
- What opportunities are present for rural researchers to engage positively with this theme
- What challenges and barriers does this theme present for rural CSCW work
- How might this theme connect to other themes/the broader rural context
  
This discussion will identify some goals that can be the obejctive for a rural CSCW action plan

### 11:25 - 11:45 From goals to actions (group discussions)

In groups, we will identify possible actions that could be taken by the rural CSCW community to contribute to achieving these goals.
For each action, we will consider:
- Why this action would advance progress on a particular goal
- What approaches/methods we should take to this action
- How might this action might contribute to or undermine progress on our other goals

### 11:45 - 12:15 Prioritising actions and next steps

Each group will be able to feed back their actions. We will collectively discuss which actions might have the greatest impact and which actions face the most barriers to implementation. We will use this discussion to prioritise immediate next steps in the form of key directions for CSCW research to engage with rural challenges.

### 12:15 - 13:15 Lunch

### Submission Format

We are asking participants  to submit an example of their work, such as a case study, position statement or equivalent, that demonstrates engagement either with rural informatics/rural computing or with a relevant area of interest. We are keen to keep the barrier to entry as low as possible to encourage participation from a wide range of academics and practitioners

We will select participants on the basis of ensuring
the discussions are dynamic and engaging and that all participants have time and
space to contribute whilst also including a broad range of backgrounds and
perspectives.

The deadline for submissions is the*~~30th May~~**12th June** (23:59 AoE). Successful authors will be notified on the 17th June and the workshop will take place on the 1st July.

Please submit using **[this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=yRJQnBa2wkSpF2aBT74-h-KB8YKuT_ZFnVbg1fRTp_VUQVJVUUQ5UVFaSzNEUDRFTFExMUs3SjBIWC4u)**.

### Registration

Workshop participants must register for either the Pre-Conference or Full Week conference.

**The deadline for early-bird registration has now been extended to the 30th May and prices for pre-conference registration have been reduced.**

Details about conference registration can be found on the ECSCW '25 conference website **[here](https://ecscw.eusset.eu/2025/index.php/registration-costs/)**

### Workshop Themes

The overall aim of this workshop will be to create a plan of action for future rural
informatics research that bridges sociological considerations (i.e. that has a good
understanding of the challenges) with computing (i.e. what are the technological
potentials for sustainable and resilient rural communities). We aim to explore:
what approaches are required in rural contexts? What can we learn from prior
CSCW work and its breakdowns? What additional complexities are there when
designing technologies in, for, with, and from the rural?

We suggest five broad topics for discussion, that cover the ontological nature (how
the rural came to be), epistemological questions (how we know and understand the
rural) and methodological questions (how we intervene as researchers and
designers) relevant to rural computing research:

1. Approaching the rural: Why rural? Establishing motivations and
inspirations.
2. Defining the rural: Who isrural? Identities, characteristics, and positionality.
3. Imagining the rural: Where is the rural? Contexts, boundaries, and
discourses; there is no single vantage point from which to see the rural whole;
so, we need to reflect upon the lenses (e.g. academic, media, lay), and frames
that we privilege, bypass, draw from, start from or end with.
4. Re-imagining the rural: When is the rural? How could different lenses and
frames of rural identities be used to re-imagine the rural?
5. Re-making the rural: How rural? Setting out approaches, methods, and
priorities.
