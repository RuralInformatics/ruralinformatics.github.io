Despite almost a quarter of the world’s population living in rural areas, ruralfocused CSCW makes up a tiny fraction of published CSCW research and design. When
CSCW work does focus on the rural there are issues with the way rurality is identified and
understood and limitations in the approaches to research and design in rural contexts.
Building on a recent increased interest in rural informatics, which has drawn on social
science scholarship to take stock of previous rural research and set an agenda for rural
computing, we aim to identify opportunities for CSCW research to engage with rural issues
and foster a rural informatics community of practice. As the world relies ever more on rural
areas and the importance of information technology to rural resilience is ever more
apparent, the need to innovate and design from the rural must become more central to
CSCW. 

This workshop will provide researchers and practitioners interested in rural CSCW
and rural computing an opportunity to discuss future directions and share insights,
ideas, and issues from different rural contexts. It will facilitate cross-disciplinary
and cross-sector discussion, sharing, and understanding on current issues, research,
and community development work. The workshop will create an opportunity to
collaboratively set pathways and approaches for a rural informatics research
agenda. We aim to create an action plan that will orient future activity around key
rural challenges where CSCW researchers can have the biggest impact.

## Schedule

The workshop ran over a half-day.

### 9:30 - 10:30  Presentations and provocations

Participants were invited to give short "lightning" presentations of around 3-5 mins to introduce themselves and their experiences of working in rural settings.

### 10:30 - 10:45 Coffee break

There will be an opportunity to discuss informally what themes have emerged from the presentations and from participant's own work and experiences. 

### 10:45 - 11:25 From themes to goals (group discussions)

Small group discussions to identify goals for future actions on key themes in rural CSCW.

### 11:25 - 11:45 From goals to actions (group discussions)

Small group discussions envisaging possible actions that could be taken by the rural CSCW community to further previously identified goals.

### 11:45 - 12:15 Prioritising actions and next steps

Each group will be able to feed back their actions. Collectively actions will be prioritised based on which might have the greatest impact and which actions face the most barriers to implementation. The result will be some immediate next steps in the form of key directions for CSCW research to engage with rural challenges.

### 12:15 - 13:15 Lunch


## Participation

**Submission Format:** Example of your work, such as a case study, position statement or equivalent, that demonstrates engagement either with rural informatics/rural computing or with a relevant area of interest

**Submission Deadline:** ~~May 30th~~ June 12th, 2025 (23:59 AoE)

**Notification of Acceptance:** June 17th, 2025

**Workshop Date:** July 1, 2025

### Submission Format

We are asking participants  to submit an example of their work, such as a case study, position statement or equivalent, that demonstrates engagement either with rural informatics/rural computing or with a relevant area of interest. We are keen to keep the barrier to entry as low as possible to encourage participation from a wide range of academics and practitioners

We will select participants on the basis of ensuring
the discussions are dynamic and engaging and that all participants have time and
space to contribute whilst also including a broad range of backgrounds and

### Workshop Themes

The overall aim of this workshop will be to create a plan of action for future rural
informatics research that bridges sociological considerations (i.e. that has a good
understanding of the challenges) with computing (i.e. what are the technological
potentials for sustainable and resilient rural communities). We aim to explore:
what approaches are required in rural contexts? What can we learn from prior
CSCW work and its breakdowns? What additional complexities are there when
designing technologies in, for, with, and from the rural?

We suggest five broad topics for discussion, that cover the ontological nature (how
the rural came to be), epistemological questions (how we know and understand the
rural) and methodological questions (how we intervene as researchers and
designers) relevant to rural computing research:

1. Approaching the rural: Why rural? Establishing motivations and
inspirations.
2. Defining the rural: Who isrural? Identities, characteristics, and positionality.
3. Imagining the rural: Where is the rural? Contexts, boundaries, and
discourses; there is no single vantage point from which to see the rural whole;
so, we need to reflect upon the lenses (e.g. academic, media, lay), and frames
that we privilege, bypass, draw from, start from or end with.
4. Re-imagining the rural: When is the rural? How could different lenses and
frames of rural identities be used to re-imagine the rural?
5. Re-making the rural: How rural? Setting out approaches, methods, and
priorities.
